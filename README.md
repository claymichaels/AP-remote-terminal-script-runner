# AP-remote-terminal-script-runner
Remotely run WING shell commands agains a Motorola AP

A Python script to read in a .script file containing WING4/5 shell commands for Motorola/Zebra Access Points. This could be extended easily for other device types, I imagine. 

Repo includes sample script files, and two simple .sh scripts to run the python script against multiple devices.
